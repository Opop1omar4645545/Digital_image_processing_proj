# MATLAB GUI Image Processing Toolbox

Welcome to the MATLAB GUI Image Processing Toolbox repository! This project provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) containing various image processing functions to enhance, manipulate, and analyze digital images.

## Description

This repository houses MATLAB code for a GUI-based image processing toolbox. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this toolbox offers a user-friendly interface to perform a wide range of image processing tasks.

## Features

### Image Enhancement:
- **Upsampling**
- **Subsampling**
- **Smoothing (Average, Standard)**
- **Sharpening (Diagonal Laplacian, Robert Horizontal, Robert Vertical, Sobel Horizontal, Sobel Vertical)**
- **Gray Slicing (AP#1, AP#2)**
- **Negative Transformation**
- **Log Transformation**
- **Inverse Log Transformation**
- **Power Law Transformation**
- **Contrast Stretching**
- **Thresholding (0,1)**
- **Bit Plane Slicing**

### Image Arithmetic:
- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Image Subtraction**
- **Multiplication**
- **Division**
- **Logical AND**
- **Logical OR**

### Image Analysis:
- **Histogram**
- **Histogram Equalization**

### Filters:
- **Smoothing (Average Weight, Median)**
- **Sharpening (Laplacian, Composite Laplacian, Robert First Derivative, Sobel First Derivative)**
- **Low Pass Filter (Ideal, Butterworth, Gaussian)**
- **High Pass Filter (Ideal, Butterworth, Gaussian)**

### Other:
- **Grey Level Resolution**
- **Smoothing (Modified)**
